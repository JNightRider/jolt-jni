# Jolt JNI

[The Jolt-JNI Project][project] provides
[JVM] bindings for [Jolt Physics][jolt]
and [Khaled Mamou's V-HACD Library][vhacd],
to facilitate physics simulation in JVM languages such as [Java] and [Kotlin].

Source code (in Java and C++) is provided under

## Translating Jolt Physics applications into Java

There’s close correspondence between the class/method names
of Jolt Physics and Jolt JNI.
For example:

+ The `Body` class in Jolt JNI will (eventually) provide
  all the functionality of the `Body` class in Jolt Physics.
+ The `ConstBody` interface will include all the `const` methods
  of the Jolt Physics `Body` class, such as its `GetPosition()` method,
  which in Jolt JNI is called `getPosition()`.

Things become slightly more interesting when C++ templates
and public member data are involved. For instance:

+ An array of body IDs is `Array<BodyID>` in Jolt Physics;
  in Jolt JNI it’s called a `BodyIdVector`.
+ The `mConvexRadius` member of the `BoxShapeSettings` class
  is accessed using `getConvexRadius()` and `setConvexRadius()` in Jolt JNI.

For a couple well-known Jolt Physics examples,
[line-for-line translations into Java](https://github.com/stephengold/jolt-jni/tree/master/src/test/java/testjoltjni/app)
are provided.

## Acknowledgments

Jolt JNI is derived from open-source software:

  + the [Jolt Physics][jolt] project
  + [Khaled Mamou's V-HACD Library][vhacd] for approximate convex decomposition

Useful code was contributed by wil (aka JNightRider).

This project also made use of the following software tools:

  + the [Android Studio][studio], [IntelliJ IDEA][idea], and [NetBeans]
    integrated development environments
  + the [Checkstyle] tool
  + the [Firefox] web browser
  + the [GNU Compiler Collection][gcc] and [Project Debugger][gdb]
  + the [Git] revision-control system and GitK commit viewer
  + the [GitKraken] client
  + the [Gradle] build tool
  + the [Java] compiler, standard doclet, and runtime environment
  + the [Linux Mint][mint] operating system
  + the [LLVM Compiler Infrastructure][llvm]
  + the [Markdown] document-conversion tool
  + the [Meld] visual merge tool
  + Microsoft Windows and Visual Studio

I am grateful to Riccardo Balbo (aka "riccardo") for bringing
V-HACD to my attention.

I am grateful to [GitHub], [Sonatype],
[Travis], and [MacStadium]
for providing free hosting for this project
and many other open-source projects.

I'm also grateful to my dear Holly, for keeping me sane.

If I've misattributed anything or left anyone out, please let me know, so I can
correct the situation: sgold@sonic.net
